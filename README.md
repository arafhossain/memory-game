# memory-game
Udacity Front-End-Developer Memory Game Project
---

The game will allow the user to track the number of moves they made, the amount of time they take from the beginning of their first card choice, the high score, and the number of games they played. The circular arrow allows them to restart a game, resetting their current game stats. Upon finishing a game (selecting all paired cards), a user is presented with the amount of moves they made, and their total time taken, with the message asking if they'd like to play again.

Primary tools used include query selectors, timers, classes, event handlers, and listeners.
