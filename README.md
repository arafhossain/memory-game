The object of this copy of the classic game 'Concentration' is for a user to flip over 'cards' and match them with their identical pair. The game ends when all 'cards' are matched and revealed.

This game will allow the user to track the number of moves they made, the amount of time they take from the choice of their first card, the fastest time, and the number of games they played. The circular arrow button allows them to restart a game, resetting their current game. Upon finishing a game (selecting all paired cards), a user is presented with the amount of moves they made, and their total time taken, with the message asking if they'd like to play again.
